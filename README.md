## Play Do Re Mi

[Live App](https://noisemaker.now.sh/)

This project was created in response to the noisemaker challenge!

A basic xylophone style set of keys are laid out to demonstrate the notes "DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO"

When a key is clicked, the corresponding note letter appears. When the reset button is clicked the keys reset to display "DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO"

This application used the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/) library.

The app was inspired by this [website](https://www.letsplaykidsmusic.com/fun-music-theory-do-re-mi/).

This application used the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/) library to make the notes possible.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
